During my first week of work at Macy's Tech, I felt lost with all the new acronyms and jargon, so I built this JavaFX application, called the Macy's Acronym Dictionary (MAD) that uses JDBC to connect to a MySQL database which contains the acronyms and information about them. This application helps me and other new hires comprehend the acronyms and jargon quickly and easily.

With this tool, Macy's employees can do the following:
1. Search terms and see their data
2. Add new terms to the database 
3. Remove terms from the database 
4. Edit the data of terms in the database 
5. Reset the database
6. Learn more about this project and its developer (me)
7. Download all the data in the database to store on their local machines

Any and every Macy's employee will be in the know about what is going on with this application!

This tool is an excellent display of my skills with Java, SQL, JavaFX, JDBC, and MySQL database technology, and it will help other new hires better adjust to their new workplace.

In this application, I directly ran a SQL script (.sql file) from my Java code by using a Java file (.java file) called ScriptRunner.java and its dependencies. The code in that Java file and its dependencies belongs to a GitHub user by the screen name of BenoitDuffez. The associated code for integrating ScriptRunner.java with my own Java code also belongs to BenoitDuffez. The ScriptRunner.java file, its dependencies, and the integration code can be found on one of BenoitDuffez's GitHub repositories. Here is the link: https://github.com/BenoitDuffez/ScriptRunner. I have used the assets from this repository responsibly, rightfully, and fairly in the development of my project.
